Have the function ThreeFiveMultiples(num) return the sum of all the 
multiples of 3 and 5 that are below num. For example: if num is 10, 
the multiples of 3 and 5 that are below 10 are 3, 5, 6, and 9, and 
adding them up you get 23, so your program should return 23. 
The integer being passed will be between 1 and 100. 

def ThreeFiveMultiples(num)
	final_array = (2...num).select do |el|
		el % 3 == 0 or el % 5 == 0 
	end
	return 0 if num == 1 
	final_array.reduce(:+)
end
