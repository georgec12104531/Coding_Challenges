Have the function FibonacciChecker(num) return the string yes 
if the number given is part of the Fibonacci sequence. This 
sequence is defined by: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, which means to find 
Fn you add the previous two numbers up. The first two numbers 
are 0 and 1, then comes 1, 2, 3, 5 etc. If num is not in the 
Fibonacci sequence, return the string no. 

def FibonacciChecker(num)
	f_sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
		until num <= f_sequence[-1] 
			new_num = f_sequence[-2..-1].reduce(:+)
			f_sequence << new_num
			return "yes" if f_sequence[-1] == num
		end	
	return "no"
end
