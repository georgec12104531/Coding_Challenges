Have the function NonrepeatingCharacter(str) take the 
str parameter being passed, which will contain only 
alphabetic characters and spaces, and return the first 
non-repeating character. For example: if str is 
"agettkgaeee" then your program should return k. 
The string will always contain at least one character 
and there will always be at least one non-repeating character. 

def NonrepeatingCharacter(str)
	str.each_char {|ch| return ch if str.count(ch) < 2}
end
