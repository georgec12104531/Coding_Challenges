Have the function Superincreasing(arr) take the array 
of numbers stored in arr and determine if the array forms 
a superincreasing sequence where each element in the array 
is greater than the sum of all previous elements. The array 
will only consist of positive integers. For example: 
if arr is [1, 3, 6, 13, 54] then your program should return 
the string "true" because it forms a superincreasing sequence. 
If a superincreasing sequence isn't formed, then your program 
should return the string "false"

def Superincreasing(arr)
    sum = arr[0] 
    (1..arr.length-1).each do |i|
        return "false" if arr[i] < sum
        sum += arr[i]
    end
    return "true"
end
