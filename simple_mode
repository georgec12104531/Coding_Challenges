Have the function SimpleMode(arr) take the array of numbers 
stored in arr and return the number that appears most frequently 
(the mode). For example: if arr contains [10, 4, 5, 2, 4] the 
output should be 4. If there is more than one mode return the 
one that appeared in the array first (ie. [5, 10, 10, 6, 5] 
should return 5 because it appeared first). If there is no 
mode return -1. The array will not be empty. 

def SimpleMode(arr)
	counter_hash = Hash.new(0)
	arr.each {|el| counter_hash[el] += 1}
	return -1 if counter_hash.values.all? {|el| arr.count(el) == arr.count(arr[0])}
	counter_hash.max_by {|k,v| v}[0]
end
