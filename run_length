Have the function RunLength(str) take the str parameter 
being passed and return a compressed version of the string 
using the Run-length encoding algorithm. This algorithm 
works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character 
and outputting that number along with a single character 
of the repeating sequence. For example: "wwwggopp" would 
return 3w2g1o2p. The string will not contain any numbers, 
punctuation, or symbols. 

def RunLength(str)
	new_hash = Hash.new
	final_array = ""
	str.chars.uniq.each {|el| new_hash[el] = str.count(el)}
	new_hash.values.each_with_index do |el, idx|
		final_array << "#{new_hash.values[idx]}#{new_hash.keys[idx]}"
		#final_array << "#{new_hash.keys[idx]}"
	end
	final_array 
end
