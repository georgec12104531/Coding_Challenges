Have the function StockPicker(arr) take the array of numbers stored 
in arr which will contain integers that represent the amount in dollars 
that a single stock is worth, and return the maximum profit that could 
have been made by buying stock on day x and selling stock on day y where 
y > x. For example: if arr is [44, 30, 24, 32, 35, 30, 40, 38, 15] then 
your program should return 16 because at index 2 the stock was worth $24 
and at index 6 the stock was then worth $40, so if you bought the stock 
at 24 and sold it at 40, you would have made a profit of $16, which is 
the maximum profit that could have been made with this list of stock 
prices. 

If there is not profit that could have been made with the stock prices, 
then your program should return -1. For example: arr is [10, 9, 8, 2] 
then your program should return -1. 

def StockPicker(arr)
	max_profit = 0
	(0..arr.length-2).each do |i|
		(i+1..arr.length-1).each do |i2|
			difference = arr[i2] - arr[i]
			max_profit = difference if difference > max_profit
		end
	end
	return -1 if max_profit.zero?
	return max_profit 
end
