# Write a method that binary searches an array for a target and returns its
# index if found. Assume a sorted array.

# NB: YOU MUST WRITE THIS RECURSIVELY (searching half of the array every time).
# We will not give you points if you visit every element in the array every time
# you search.

# For example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 4], you should NOT be checking
# 1 first, then 2, then 3, then 4.

  when 0
