Have the function MaxSubarray(arr) take the array of numbers 
stored in arr and determine the largest sum that can be formed 
by any contiguous subarray in the array. For example, if arr is 
[-2, 5, -1, 7, -3] then your program should return 11 because 
the sum is formed by the subarray [5, -1, 7]. Adding any element 
before or after this subarray would make the sum smaller. 

def MaxSubarray(arr)
	combo_i = 1
	max = 0 
	until combo_i == arr.length + 1
		arr.each_cons(combo_i).each do |el|
			max = el.reduce(:+) if el.reduce(:+) > max
		end
		combo_i += 1 
	end
	max
end
