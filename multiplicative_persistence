Have the function MultiplicativePersistence(num) take the 
num parameter being passed which will always be a positive 
integer and return its multiplicative persistence which is the 
number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you 
reach a single digit. For example: if num is 39 then your program 
should return 3 because 3 * 9 = 27 then 2 * 7 = 14 and finally 1 * 4 = 4 
and you stop at 4. 

def MultiplicativePersistence(num)
    return 0 if num < 10 
    count = 0 
    until num < 10 
        count += 1 and num = num.to_s.chars.map(&:to_i).reduce(:*)
    end
    count
end
