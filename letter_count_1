Have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter 
being passed and return the first word with the greatest 
number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the 
greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 
2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. 
If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words 
will be separated by spaces. 

def letter_count(str)
    uniq_char = str.chars.uniq
    uniq_char.count do |ch|
        str.count(ch) > 1
    end
end

def LetterCountI(str)
    word_hash = Hash.new
    string_array = str.split(" ")
    string_array.each do |word|
        word_hash[word] = letter_count(word)
    end
    return -1 if word_hash.values.reduce(:+).zero?
    word_hash.max_by {|k,v| v}[0]
end
