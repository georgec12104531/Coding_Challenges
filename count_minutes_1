Have the function CountingMinutesI(str) take the str 
parameter being passed which will be two times (each 
properly formatted with a colon and am or pm) separated 
by a hyphen and return the total number of minutes between 
the two times. The time will be in a 12 hour clock format. 
For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am then the output should 
be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320. 

def time(str)
    hours, mins = str.split(":")
    hours = hours.to_i % 12
    hours += 12 if mins.include?("pm")
    time = Time.new(1,1,1,hours, mins.to_i)
end


# - .split the two different times 
# - subtract the two times 

def CountingMinutesI(str)
	time1, time2 = str.split("-")
	difference = (time(time1) - time(time2)) / 60
	final_minutes = 1440 - (difference % 1440).abs.round
end
