Have the function ChangingSequence(arr) take the array of numbers 
stored in arr and return the index at which the numbers stop increasing 
and begin decreasing or stop decreasing and begin increasing. 
For example: if arr is [1, 2, 4, 6, 4, 3, 1] then your program should 
return 3 because 6 is the last point in the array where the numbers were 
increasing and the next number begins a decreasing sequence. The array will 
contain at least 3 numbers and it may contains only a single sequence, 
increasing or decreasing. If there is only a single sequence in the array, 
then your program should return -1. Indexing should begin with 0. 

# Input: Array 
# Output: Integer or -1 

# - determine if the array is increasing or decreasing arr[0] < arr[1]
# - loop through the array (0..arr.length-2)
# - if decreasing... if increasing, return the arr.index(arr[i]) if arr[i + 1] ...
# - return -1 


def ChangingSequence(arr)
    #increasing
    if arr[0] < arr[1]
        (0..arr.length-2).each do |i|
            return i if arr[i + 1] < arr[i]
        end
    end
    
    #decreasing
    if arr[1] < arr[0]
        (0..arr.length-2).each do |i|
            return i if arr[i + 1] > arr[i]
        end
    end
    
    return -1
end
