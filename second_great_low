Have the function SecondGreatLow(arr) take the array of numbers 
stored in arr and return the second lowest and second greatest 
numbers, respectively, separated by a space. For example: if arr 
contains [7, 7, 12, 98, 106] the output should be 12 98. The array 
will not be empty and will contain at least 2 numbers. It can get 
tricky if there's just two numbers! 

def SecondGreatLow(arr)
    arr = arr.uniq.sort
    return "#{arr[1]} #{arr[0]}" if arr.length == 2 
    return "#{arr[1]} #{arr[-2]}"
end
