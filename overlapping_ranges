Have the function OverlappingRanges(arr) take the array of numbers stored 
in arr which will contain 5 positive integers, the first two representing 
a range of numbers (a to b), the next 2 also representing another range of 
integers (c to d), and a final 5th element (x) which will also be a positive 
integer, and return the string true if both sets of ranges overlap by at least 
x numbers. For example: if arr is [4, 10, 2, 6, 3] then your program should 
return the string true. The first range of numbers are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 
and the second range of numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The last element in the array 
is 3, and there are 3 numbers that overlap between both ranges: 4, 5, and 6. If 
both ranges do not overlap by at least x numbers, then your program should 
return the string false. 


# Input: Array
# Output: true/false

# - Find the range with the highest max_num
# - if the numbers with the highest max_num's MIN numbers is lower than the max numbers of the second range 
# - min number's max - the min number >= target??

    if arr[1] > arr[2]

    difference = min_largest - max_smallest
    difference + 1 >= target
