Have the function OtherProducts(arr) take the array of numbers 
stored in arr and return a new list of the products of all the 
other numbers in the array for each element. For example: 
if arr is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] then the new array, where each location 
in the new array is the product of all other elements, is [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. 
The following calculations were performed to get this answer: 
[(2*3*4*5), (1*3*4*5), (1*2*4*5), (1*2*3*5), (1*2*3*4)]. 
You should generate this new array and then return the numbers 
as a string joined by a hyphen: 120-60-40-30-24. The array will 
contain at most 10 elements and at least 1 element of only positive integers. 



# Input: Arr
# Output: String

# - Create a final_array, create a sub_array 
# - Loop through the array (0..arr.length-1)
# - reduce the current sub_array and shovel the product into the final_array 
# - final_array.join("-")

def OtherProducts(arr)
    final_array, sub_product = [], []
    (0..arr.length-1).each do |i|
        sub_array = arr[0...i] + arr[i+1..-1]
        final_array << sub_array.reduce(:*)
    end
    final_array.join("-")
end
